## ðŸ§  Project Context

This project is a multichannel prospecting automation tool that allows users to:

- Send direct messages via **Facebook Messenger** and **Instagram DMs**
- Use **message templates** with variables like `{{firstName}}` or `{{company}}`
- **Tag and segment contacts**
- **Schedule campaigns** with randomized delay to avoid spam detection
- **Sync contacts, messages, and tags with Zoho CRM**
- View messages in a **unified inbox** and manage reply tracking
- Eventually integrate with other CRMs like HubSpot or Pipedrive

The goal is to help freelancers and sales professionals automate and centralize their outreach workflows in a CRM-integrated way.
